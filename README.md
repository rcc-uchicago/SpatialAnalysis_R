# Part 1 Geospatial Concepts
1. Software and packages for GIS analysis
2. Basic GIS operations.
3. Understanding the Census
4. Spatial Analysis with Vector data
5. Geocoding and Geo-referencing
6. Basic web mapping techniques


# Part 2 Spatial Analysis with R
 This training course introduces SF, an R package for handling geographic data.

The size of spatial data sets continues to grow, and advanced tools for their analysis are needed. R has become a widely used open-source tool for spatial data analysis and visualization. This training course introduces SF, an R package for handling geographic data. Participants will be provided with basic knowledge about spatial data manipulation and map visualization using R, as well as the fundamental principles and the specific methods for creating interactive maps using R. Participants will be provided with the necessary information for applying R's powerful suite of geographical tools to their own problems.

**Objectives:**

1.  The structure of spatial objects in R
2.  Loading and interrogating spatial data with sf
3.  Data manipulation with spatial data using dplyr
4.  Spatial operations such as intersections
5.  Interactive maps with leaflet


**Level:** Introductory
