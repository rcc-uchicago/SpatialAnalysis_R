# SpatialAnalysis_R
 This training course introduces SF, an R package for handling geographic data.

The size of spatial data sets continues to grow, and advanced tools for their analysis are needed. R has become a widely used open-source tool for spatial data analysis and visualization. This training course introduces SF, an R package for handling geographic data. Participants will be provided with basic knowledge about spatial data manipulation and map visualization using R, as well as the fundamental principles and the specific methods for creating interactive maps using R. Participants will be provided with the necessary information for applying R's powerful suite of geographical tools to their own problems.

Objectives:

 The structure of spatial objects in R
 
 Loading and interrogating spatial data with sf
 
 Data manipulation with spatial data using dplyr
 
 Spatial operations such as intersections
 
 Interactive maps with leaflet

Level: Introductory
